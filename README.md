Online road tax payment (web app)

I created a web application for online road tax payment using web development basics (HTML/CSS for frontend PHP for backend and ORACLE SQLDEVELOPER for database). 
*First there is the main page in 'HTML' folder "index.html" file which contains two parts (one for users to subscribe and use the app and the other part is for admins)
==> An admin can only make a login.

*The subscription page is private so it can not be included in the general site so you can find the sign up page for admins in 'ADMIN' folder in "index.html" file.

*So the space of users is made with the classic coding method 


*Admin space is made with MVC (model-view-controller) method, inside the folder '1_MVC' you will find 4 folders:
_config: which contains the database information.
_Model
_View
_Controller
_And the "index.php" file which will route the URL to the appropriate controllers/actions.
